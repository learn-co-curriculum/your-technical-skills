# Technical Skills

A key component of your resume is the portfolio of Technical Skills that you possess. This gives a company or recruiter a convenient snapshot of your technical proficiencies, helping them to quickly qualify your candidacy.  While this section is pretty simple and straightforward, keep in mind the following do’s and don’ts when populating this section.

## The DO's and DONT's of the Technical Skills Section

**DO** include technologies:
- you learned in your Flatiron curriculum
- you can speak in detail about
- you can confidently complete a code challenge/assessment in
- you learned previously that are part of your specialty skillset, especially if related to your target role (i.e. PhotoShop or Adobe Suite for a design or UX/UI-centric role, Bloomberg for a finance company, Google Analytics for a social media marketing/analytics company, etc.)

**DON'T** include technologies:
- you have only had brief exposure to
- you cannot explain or complete a code challenge/assessment in confidently
- considered basic and standard across all industries and not relevant to your field of study (i.e. Microsoft Word)

In addition, you’ll want to make sure that you keep this section of your resume accurate and up to date, in case you acquire any new skills that a potential employer or recruiter should know about. This helps optimize the visibility of your resume as well as your competitiveness in the greater job market as a whole.
