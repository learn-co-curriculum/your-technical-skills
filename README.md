Please view this [List of Hard Cybersecurity Analytics Skills](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HmSMZTGdZm0MvjdKhYM1M2pjPW_1xglEu2Rqd050fSo/edit#) for this discipline. 

A key component of your resume is the portfolio of Technical Skills that you possess. This gives a company or recruiter a convenient snapshot of your technical proficiencies, helping them to quickly qualify your candidacy.  While this section is pretty simple and straightforward, keep in mind the following do’s and don’ts when populating this section.

Be aware that  employers will often interview multiple people  at a time. They typically relay that the resumes they are viewing are boring and don’t contain enough technical skills. We highly encourage you to individualize your resumes/CV’s by adding your own touch to the framework we're providing here.  You’ll want to be adding projects, keeping track of the skills you’ve gained in your labs, and correlating all that to the job you’d like to earn after graduation. 

## The DO's and DONT's of the Technical Skills Section

**DO** include technologies:
- you learned in your Flatiron curriculum
- you can speak in detail about
- you can confidently complete a challenge/assessment in
- you learned previously that are part of your specialty skillset, especially if related to your target role (i.e. Bloomberg for a finance company, Google Analytics for a social media marketing/analytics company, etc.)

**DON'T** include technologies:
- you have only had brief exposure to
- you cannot explain or complete a challenge/assessment in confidently
- considered basic and standard across all industries and not relevant to your field of study (i.e. Microsoft Word)

In addition, you’ll want to make sure that you keep this section of your resume accurate and up to date, in case you acquire any new skills that a potential employer or recruiter should know about. This helps optimize the visibility of your resume as well as your competitiveness in the greater job market as a whole.
